# DealCloud for Python

This package provides two functions for working with the DealCloud Web Service
from Python: `create_client()` and `bind_service()`. It also comes with
examples of basic usage. As a SOAP service, the usage pattern will be familiar
to those with experience with XML and SOAP services.

To get started, create your virtual environment and install this package by
cloning this repository and running the setup script.

```
python setup.py install
```

That's it! All you need to do now is review the examples and apply similar
patterns.
